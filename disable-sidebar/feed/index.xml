					<description><![CDATA[Sorry David for not responding to your question. I do not know whether you still need an answer or not but the answer is this. If you have the theme in your computer, login to your cpanel, click on file manager and locate the folder public_html (which has all the files you need for the website. If you are using Wordpress as your web design platform, click on wp-content, go to themes and you will see the theme that you need to uninstall. Delete it and install it afresh and your website will be back to normal only that you will need to make some few edits....thanks. Let me know anything else regarding Wordpress, I will be happy to help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I want to remove sidebar from all pages. I went through the above code and I am not very clear about where to paste the above code in order to disable the sidebar. My single.php looks like this. Could you please help me with this? Also I had experiences of the whole site stopping working as soon as I modify something in functions.php file. Can anyone please share what precautions we need to take before deploying changes to our functions.php page.
