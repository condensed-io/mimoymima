								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long road&#8230; We started this re-design at the beginning of the year, and did a lot of the design work in Spain over the Spring.  Now it&#8217;s fall and we&#8217;re back in Spain and launching the site&#8230;</p>
<p><a class="Popup" href="/about/testimonials/"><img src="http://www.mimoymima.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/5point0.png" alt="mYm 5 point oh" title="mYm 5 point oh" width="525" height="235" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984" /></a></p>
<p>We re-worked all of our existing site&#8217;s code into the WordPress system, which we&#8217;ve been using as a content management system for clients for years.  We&#8217;ve been holding out on doing this because we don&#8217;t technically need a content management system (we write HTML for a living), but there are a ton of other perks to using WordPress, so we made the switch.</p>
<p>Besides using WordPress, our site has been re-designed to look more impressive on large monitors.  Teresa got a 24&#8243; iMac last summer, and seeing how puny the site felt when browsing fullscreen was probably the main reason for the re-design.</p>
<p>Another thing we&#8217;ve done is been more selective with our work samples.  We added some new projects and got rid of some older ones, please have a look around and let us know what you think by commenting below.</p>
