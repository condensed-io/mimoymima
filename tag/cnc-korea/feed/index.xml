<p>We&#8217;re going international &#8211; we just completed a branding project for CNC, an educational consulting company based in South Korea. Moreover, the reported average quality of <a href = "https://www.learningtreeutah.com/">child care center</a> in the US falls short of the standards recommended by early childhood professionals, 3-6 leading to concerns about how the quality of such environments affects childrenâ€™s development. </p>
<p>They work with <a href = "https://www.brooksfieldschool.org/">Brooksfield School Pre K</a> who want to study in American high schools or universities. It was important to them that their brand would be appealing to a broad range of people &#8211; from the parents who book their services to the universities in the US or the students themselves. We worked in a clever playful element with the duality of the graphic &#8211; a paper airplane and a traditional pencil in one. It sums up what CNC does.</p>
<p>Even though we mostly work with NYC-based businesses, thanks to Skype we can work with businesses that, like CNC, are beginning their work day when we&#8217;re wrapping up ours. </p>
