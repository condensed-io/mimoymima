								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Intro">For the past few months we&#8217;ve been collaborating with California multimedia firm, <a href="http://mixedmediaworkshop.com/" class="Popup">Mixed Media Workshop,</a> making three movies sites; one is directed by Emilio Estevez, one is an Oscar winner this year, and the other is a sexy thriller by Atom Egoyan.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.theway-themovie.com/" class="Popup">The Way</a></h2>

<a href="http://www.theway-themovie.com/" class="Popup"><img src="http://www.mimoymima.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/photo_emelio.jpg" alt="Still From The Way - Emilio Estevez" title="Visit the website for The Way" width="525" height="165" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3033" /></a>

<p><em>The Way</em> stars Martin Sheen and is directed by his son Emilio Estevez.  After Emilio&#8217;s character is killed while hiking the Camino De Santiago, his father takes his ashes in an urn and walks the Camino to mourn and honor his son. The film follows his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Since the better half of mimoYmima is Spanish, we&#8217;ve taken many trips to Spain to visit family and travel the country.  On one of our trips we visited Santiago de Compostela and loved it. The landscape in the north of Spain is breathtaking, the seafood is spectacular and the stunning cathedral houses the remains of one of the Apostles.</p>

<p>This Sony Pictures Classics release stars Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson and is directed by art film director, Atom Egoyan. We pulled together a lot of programming tricks for this site and we&#8217;re very proud of the way it came out.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/thesecretintheireyes/" class="Popup">The Secret In Their Eyes</a></h2>

<a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/thesecretintheireyes/" class="Popup"><img src="http://www.mimoymima.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/photo_secret.jpg" alt="still from The Secret In Their Eyes" title="visit the website - The Secret In Their Eyes" width="525" height="156" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3037" /></a>

<p>Winner of the Oscar for best foreign film this year, <em>The Secret In Their Eyes</em> is another Sony Pictures Classics release.  We programmed this mini-site which has the feel of a movie poster come to life.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re working on another film site with Mixed Media <em>(more on that soon)</em> and are looking forward to more to come.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="/mimoymima-goes-hollywood/">mimoYmima goes Hollywood</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="/">mimoYmima</a>.</p>
