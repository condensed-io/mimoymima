								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disclaimer: This work isn&#8217;t by any way commissioned or requested by the company, we just find logos we think need work and fix them.  It&#8217;s just our sacrifice to the design gods.  Please accept it:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toms-of-maine-packaging-sacrificed.png" alt="Toms of Maine Packaging - redesigned" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6947" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toms-of-maine-packaging-sacrificed.png 1902w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toms-of-maine-packaging-sacrificed-300x243.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toms-of-maine-packaging-sacrificed-768x623.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/toms-of-maine-packaging-sacrificed-1024x830.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1902px) 100vw, 1902px" /></p>
<h2>Design Improvements</h2>
<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>I love this toothpaste but hate the packaging.  This redesign reduces printing costs; three (or even two) color printing as opposed to what they probably need to do now (cmyk+4 colors).</li>
<li>Got rid of the bad clip art photo of mint that&#8217;s faded out in the corners in an attempt to make it fit into the design.</li>
<li>The new design is cleaner which is particularly important with a toothpaste &#8211; Less fonts, less clutter, easier to understand at a glance. And the best part is that if you order it online you will get it fast and safe thanks to the best <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Office-Shipping-Labels-Printers/dp/B00OTXWVXI">ProOffice shipping labels</a>.</li>

This work isn&#8217;t by any way commissioned or requested by the company, we just find logos we think need work and fix them.  It&#8217;s our sacrifice to the design gods.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 500px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/know-me-re-design.png" alt="know-me-re-design" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6940" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/know-me-re-design.png 820w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/know-me-re-design-145x300.png 145w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/know-me-re-design-768x1594.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/know-me-re-design-493x1024.png 493w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></p>
<p>The Know Me app is a good example of a forgettable icon, it uses a typical stock smiley as their defining characteristic.  We chose to keep the color, get rid of a lot of the noise &#8211; opting for flat design &#8211; got rid of the drop shadow and other design elements which clutter the icon.</p>
<p>The smile itself is more stylized and has just enough personality to be more distinguishable.</p>
<p>Hope you like it!</p>

<p>We worked closely with <a href="http://davidhermanstudio.com/civic-council-website/">David Herman Studio</a> on the site, coming up with the right look and feel, and customizing the content management system.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">We&#8217;re excited to be working with one of the most vibrant businesses in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn &#8211; Cynthia King Dance Studio is literally down the street from us. We&#8217;ve walked by the studio for years and now we&#8217;re getting to know all the fun that goes on inside.</p>

<p>Besides ballet, they offer tap dance, hip hop, toddler dance &#8211; you name it. They organize amazing shows and, luckily for us, they have great photography from their performances and students, which is surprisingly hard to find on dance studio websites. Cynthia found out about us through one of her photographers, our friend <a href="http://amywayphotography.com/">Amy Way</a>. The new design is going to truly represent this wonderful, energetic studio that has been keeping our neighborhood dancing for the last 8 years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We love working with this New York (and NJ!) based group of wedding planners! </p>
<p>We just launched <a href="http://www.alwaysabridesmaid.us/">Always A Bridesmaid</a>.  Xochitl and the team over at AAB have been getting a lot of compliments on the new design, here&#8217;s an excerpt from an email she sent us:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just wanted to thank you! I am getting SOOO much amazing feedback on the new website.  My friends, who are always very critical, are just raving and some of the TOP industry consultants have sent me messages on twitter about how great it looks.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long road&#8230; We started this re-design at the beginning of the year, and did a lot of the design work in Spain over the Spring.  Now it&#8217;s fall and we&#8217;re back in Spain and launching the site&#8230;</p>
<p><a class="Popup" href="/about/testimonials/"><img src="http://www.mimoymima.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/5point0.png" alt="mYm 5 point oh" title="mYm 5 point oh" width="525" height="235" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984" /></a></p>
<p>We re-worked all of our existing site&#8217;s code into the WordPress system, which we&#8217;ve been using as a content management system for clients for years.  We&#8217;ve been holding out on doing this because we don&#8217;t technically need a content management system (we write HTML for a living), but there are a ton of other perks to using WordPress, so we made the switch.</p>
<p>Besides using WordPress, our site has been re-designed to look more impressive on large monitors.  Teresa got a 24&#8243; iMac last summer, and seeing how puny the site felt when browsing fullscreen was probably the main reason for the re-design.</p>
<p>Another thing we&#8217;ve done is been more selective with our work samples.  We added some new projects and got rid of some older ones, please have a look around and let us know what you think by commenting below.</p>
