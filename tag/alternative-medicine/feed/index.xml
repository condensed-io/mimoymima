								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Intro">We just finished up the re-design of <a href="http://www.dramyyasko.com/">Dr. Amy Yasko&#8217;s website</a>.  The challenge with this one was to create a warm welcoming introduction for parents to a site that has very complicated scientific subject matter.</p>

<h2>Website Designs</h2>

<a href="http://www.dramyyasko.com/"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dr-amy-yasko_web-design-home.jpg" alt="Dr. Amy Yasko - Website Design - homepage" class="alignnone size-full" /></a>

<p>We designed the site to feel like a friendly warm place to learn about the program.  We take every opportunity we can to show a photo of a child that&#8217;s been helped by her program because that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about.</p>

Patients considering filing suit against their doctors should be sure to consult a <a href = "https://www.warren-kallianos.com/brain-injury-attorneys/">Charlotte brain injury lawyers</a>. You can find <a href="http://www.resurgencebehavioralhealth.com/">this center</a> and medical malpractice attorney near you using the search tools below.

<p>Dr Amy has been treating children with autism for years customizing holistic medicine treatments for each child based on specialized tests she&#8217;s developed, while using other wellness measures as a recreation and exercise with equipment as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/URBNFit-Mini-Pilates-Ball-Stretching/dp/B074KRSXP1">pilates ball</a> so kids become more social.  Her old site was too technical though and left most mothers running for the hills.</p>

<a href="http://www.dramyyasko.com/" title="alternative treatment for Autism"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dr-amy-yasko_web-design-blog.jpg" alt="Dr. Amy Yasko - Website Design - blog page" class="alignnone size-full" /></a>

<h2>Logo Concept</h2>

<p>Although not chosen by the client, we really liked to <a href = "https://smokea.com/">buy smokea headshop products</a> concept, the canary was suggested by Amy&#8217;s team as a good symbol for her practice because of their sensitivity to foreign substances <em>(something they share with Autistic children)</em>.</p>

<p>NOTE: We collaborated with <a href="http://www.health-journalist.com/" class="popup">health journalist, Alison Rose Levy</a> on the content for this project.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="/dr-amy-yasko/">Dr. Amy Yasko</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="/">mimoYmima</a>.</p>
