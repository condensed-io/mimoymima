								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website re-design for <a href="http://gottliebfoundation.org/" class="Popup">the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation</a> was the ideal project for us.  Learning about a true modern artist <em>(especially someone in the New York scene)</em> and creating a website for his foundation really got us inspired, to the point where we even worked on the identity over the holiday break because we couldn&#8217;t wait to get a jump on it.</p>

<a href="http://www.mimoymima.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/comp_gottlieb_05_home01.jpg"><img src="http://www.mimoymima.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/gottlieb_thumb_01.jpg" alt="The Gottlieb Foundation Redesign" title="gottlieb_thumb_01" width="524" height="171" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2684" /></a>

<p>While researching the life and work of Adolph Gottlieb we came across many of his &#8216;burst&#8217; paintings which he did later in his career and thought they&#8217;d be perfect for the foundation&#8217;s logo.  They&#8217;re very iconic <em>(he even has a painting called <a class="lightview" href="http://artcritical.com/blurbs/AGIcon.jpg">icon</a>)</em></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It turns out this logo isn&#8217;t going to work because it represents a very small period of the artist&#8217;s work and unfortunately people don&#8217;t know about his other periods.  So on the guidance of the foundation we&#8217;ve changed the logo to be purely type based.</p>

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/adolph-gottlieb-foundation_logo.png" alt="adolph-gottlieb-foundation_logo" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5791" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/adolph-gottlieb-foundation_logo.png 1407w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/01/adolph-gottlieb-foundation_logo-300x117.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/01/adolph-gottlieb-foundation_logo-1024x399.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1407px) 100vw, 1407px" />

<a href="http://gottliebfoundation.org/"><img src="http://www.mimoymima.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/gottlieb_photo1-525x722.jpg" alt="my favorite gottlieb photo" title="gottlieb_photo1" width="525" height="722" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3235" /></a>

<h2>Website Design</h2>

<p>Our inspiration for the layout came from modern art coffee-table books, which feature very clean and spacious layouts with modern intricate typography work placed just right.  We split the page in half vertically, something that is not easy to achieve as a web layout.  We were aware of the programming challenges that this would pose, but took it on anyway because we knew it&#8217;d be worth the extra work.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doug Young is a prolific experimental artist.  To give you and idea of his style, one of his projects was to try ot break the Guiness World Record for the longest single session playing the banjo – and he did.  His artwork makes has a sense of humor, it has a sense of irony, it&#8217;s retro but also transcends time. He&#8217;s a total original and we were really happy tho have helped him with his website.  Below is the unorthodox design for version1 of his Doug Young Alive site:</p>
