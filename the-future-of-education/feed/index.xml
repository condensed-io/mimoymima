					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I homeschool our children and Khan Academy is the absolute best resource we could find. After spending thousands of dollars on work books, books, etc; turns out all we needed was Khan Academy. That&#039;s where they learned Algebra I &#038; II, Geometry, and several other courses. FOR FREE! They still had to take the state mandated education test and both my children scored in the 95% percentile versus public school children. And now I find out John Resig has joined Sal. What a great day this turned out to be. Thanks John, I know you will work hard with Sal. ]]></description>
